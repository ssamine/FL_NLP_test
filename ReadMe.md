# Federated Training -- NLP Task

- This repository holds the scripts for training a federated training pipeline for a NLP Task of patient readmission based on the clinical text dataset.

# Dataset

- We use MIMIC-III dataset. We assume that anyone using this repository has a license to access the MIMIC-III dataset. If not, license can be obtained by applying at www.physionet.org
- Dataset needs to be loaded into the Rhino Health (RH) dashboard using the client VM.

# Load -- Dataset in Rhino Health Dashboard

This are the following steps required for the loading the dataset in the Rhino Health Dashboard
- Step 1: Relevant schema for the loading the dataset needs to uploaded on the RH dashboard
- Step 2: Upload the dataset to the client VM using the upload option in the ssh terminal
- Step 3: Move the folder to the respective loaction inside the client VM
- Step 4: Go the Rhino Health dashboard, select cohort and select Import New Cohort
- Step 5: Fill the required information in the Import New Cohort page and click on Import new cohort.
- Step 6: The cohort should be imported to the cohort section of the Rhino Health dashboard.

# Model

- [Clinical Bert Model](#https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.11975.pdf)

# Requirements

- Tested on a GCP n1-highmem-8 CPU VM instance built from the deep learning pytorch-latest-cpu-20210414 image

# Installation

- Start the GCP instance and login as jupyter user with ```gcloud compute ssh jupyter@user-name --project rosenthallab-rhino -- -L 8080:localhost:8080```
- Clone this GCP source repo, nlp_task,  to the required folder structure (```/home/jupyter/```)

# Docker Usage

- Step 1: ```cd nlp_task/nlp_task```
- Step 2: ```../gc-docker-utils/docker-push.sh rhino-gc-workgroup-dfci <docker image name>```

- Output :
```bash
jupyter2@nalawade-dxvm:/home/jupyter/Projects/fed_learn/federated_training/rhino_health/nlp/dashboard/nlp_task$ ../gc-docker-utils/docker-push.sh rhino-gc-workgroup-dfci fl_nlp51

# Rhino Health Dashboard Usage

# Loading -- Docker Container
- Step 1: Log into the Rhino Health dashboard, if login Id is not available contact [Rhino Health - Support Center](#support@rhinohealth.zendesk.com)
- Step 2: Browse to the project (Name - Federated_training)
- Step 3: Select the Model Tab from the options and select New Version 
- Step 4: Fill all the required information in the 'Create New Model' page, most of the information is auto-populated, the only thing need to be changed is 'container', select the recently uploaded container, for this case it should be fl_nlp51. Finally select 'create new model'

# Executing -- Docker Run
- Step 1: Recently, created model should appear in the top section of the current task.
- Step 2: Click on the Run tab for that model
- Step 3: Fill all the required information for the 'Run Model Training' page. 
    1. Training Cohorts: Select the training cohort for the task
    2. Validtion Cohorts: Select the validation cohort for the task
    3. Output Cohort Name Suffix: 'Suffix' for the output file
    4. Federated Server Config: Configuration file for the server
    5. Federated Server Config: Configuration file for the client
    6. Timeout: Value in Seconds for the training and inference time

# Results -- Model Output
- Model result page should show the training and the validation rows respectively
- It will be a sequential execution, so only after the training is completed the validation row will appear
- Logs for training and validation can be visualised inside the the respective rows. If any error is encountered, the log file should show the error message.
- Once the training and validation is successfully completed, validation tab should show one output cohort. This will be hyperlinked to the cohorts section.
- Clicking on the 1-cohort, should navigate to the cohorts page. This page will show the analytics that is performed on the output cohort.
- Data Completeness section of the page should show the percentage of the rows that are successfully analyzed. Features section of the page should show the distribution of each row in the output cohort file.
